There are two types of data structures, lineare and non lineare data structures. Graphs are a generalization of trees, it is a non lineare data structure.

A graph is represented by ordred pair : *G=(V,E)*.
*Definition of an ordred pair : (a,b) ≠ (b,a) if a ≠ b*
*Definition of an unordred paie : {a,b} = {b,a}*

The V is a node or vertice and the E is the list of the edges.

There are three types of graphes : 
* directed graphs also called : digraph
* undirected graphs 
* weighted graphs 

## Examples of graphes : 
*social network : undirected, unweighted graph 
*relations between website pages : directed, unweighted graph
*relations between cities : undirected, **weighted graph**
